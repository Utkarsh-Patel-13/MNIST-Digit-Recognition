# Handwritten Digits Recognition

---

### Description

This project contains notebook and code for handwritten digit recognition.
The model is implemented using tensorflow keras.

I used [MNIST Digit dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/). The dataset has 60k training and 10k testing images, each image being 28x28.

I also made a GUI to with python tinker to test the model.

### Files info

1. [digits-recognition-tensorflow](./digits-recognition-tensorflow.ipynb) contains code to train the model.
2. [model.h5](./model.h5) is the trained model.
3. [main.py](./main.py) has the code to run the GUI and test the model.

### Steps to run the project.

1. Install required libraries using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python3 main.py`
